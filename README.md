# Movies and Genres Application

In this project, I utilized React, Redux, and Redux-Sagas to display information about movies that were listed in a database.  A junction table was created to establish a Many-to-Many relationship between movies and genres.  Users have the ability to view details about a movie, and edit the movie's title and description.
